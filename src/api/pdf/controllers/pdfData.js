    pdtSubtitle:'Your API Terms are Fair, Transparent and Trustworthy. It’s a FACT.',
     abstractText:`The FACT (for FAIR API Commitment to Trust) licence is a customizable Contract that expands upon traditional API Terms of Service (ToS). Its purpose is to promote API usage  and  allow API Users to develop interoperable products, whether they be new APIs or other types of products.

     Using a standardized set of contracts that are widely accepted as safe by the community, the Core API Provider and API Users can reduce transaction costs.  The licence also aims to raise the users’ awareness of key licensing issues that the parties need to address. Furthermore, it helps companies to define a clear, unambiguous and legally-binding framework that encourages the development of products interoperable with their technologies. This can lead tot the creation of high-value products and services in a healthy, trustworthy and safe digital infrastructure ecosystem.
     
     The FACT Contract is drafted neutrally to cover all rights related to API usage including Intellectual Property rights such as patents, copyrights and trade secrets, regardless of their validity. The standard terms of the FACT licence, along with all other specific binding documents, listed in the “API contractual commitments summary”, make up the entire contract.
